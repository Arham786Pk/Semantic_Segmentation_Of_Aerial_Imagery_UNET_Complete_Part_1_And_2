ðŸš€ Part 2: Model Building & Training â€“ Satellite Imagery Semantic Segmentation
Welcome to Part 2 of our workshop series on Satellite Imagery Semantic Segmentation.
In this phase, we move beyond data preparation and focus on building, training, and saving a deep learning model using the U-Net architecture.

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Included in This Notebook
âœ… U-Net Model Architecture
A Keras-based custom implementation of U-Net designed for semantic segmentation on satellite imagery. The model supports multi-class outputs with efficient skip connections and convolutional blocks.

âœ… Custom Metric: Intersection over Union (IoU)
Implemented a Jaccard Index (IoU) function to evaluate how well the predicted segmentation maps match the ground truth.

âœ… Loss Functions
We used a combination of:

Dice Loss: To focus on class imbalance

Categorical Focal Loss: To emphasize harder examples

âœ… Model Compilation
The model was compiled with:

Optimizer: Adam

Loss: Dice Loss + Categorical Focal Loss

Metrics: Accuracy, IoU

âœ… Training
Trained on 256Ã—256 image patches from Part 1

Epochs: 30

Batch Size: 8

No data shuffling to maintain patch order

âœ… Model Saving
The final model is saved as:
Semantic_Segmentation_Of_Aerial_Imagery_UNET.h5

ðŸ”— Prerequisite
Make sure youâ€™ve completed Part 1: Data Preparation before running this notebook.
